Hi there! This is Qihao <span style="color: gray;">(pronounced as CHI-HAO)</span>.

I am a first-year PhD student at Texas A&M University working with Prof. [Nima Khademi Kalantari](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/nimak/index.html). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from HKUST in Data Science and Technology, and in Computer Science.

My research focuses on machine learning techniques for efficient and expressive light transport simulation, with experience in volumetric, differentiable and stylized rendering. I am always open to related discussions.
