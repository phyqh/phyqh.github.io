Hi there! This is Qihao <span style="color: gray;">(pronounced as CHI-HAO. My full name in Chinese is 何其昊)</span>.

I am a first-year PhD student at Texas A&M University working with Prof. [Nima Khademi Kalantari](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/nimak/index.html). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from HKUST in Data Science and Technology, and in Computer Science.

I work on machine learning-based approaches to light transport, including path guiding and volumetric rendering. I am always open to related discussions.
